### **Datasets to Avoid**

#### **Dataset 1: UNSW-NB15**

* **Reason**:  
  * Focused more on traditional network attacks and less on IoT-specific traffic.  
  * Limited information on traffic types or protocols.

---

#### **Dataset 2: NSL-KDD**

* **Reason**:  
  * Outdated dataset not representative of modern IoT traffic patterns.  
  * Insufficient granularity in feature space for advanced IoT-specific anomaly detection.

---

#### **Dataset 3: CICIDS2017**

* **Reason**:  
  * Generic intrusion detection dataset; lacks IoT or application-layer insights.  
  * Overlaps in structure with better datasets (e.g., Dataset 8 or 7).

---

#### **Dataset 4: CSE-CIC-IDS2018**

* **Reason**:  
  * Focuses more on general attack detection (e.g., DDoS, Brute Force) and less on IoT-specific anomalies.  
  * Redundant compared to Dataset 7 or 8\.

---

#### **Dataset 5: IoT-23**

* **Reason**:  
  * Narrow focus on malware in IoT rather than general traffic patterns.  
  * Lack of flow-based statistics compared to richer alternatives.
