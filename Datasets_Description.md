Dataset size:- 1.77 GB

Dataset description in detail:-

The dataset includes a comprehensive collection of network flow statistics, which provides extensive insights into the traffic characteristics seen in a network environment. Each row represents a distinct flow, as indicated by attributes such as Flow ID, Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, and Destination Port, providing for exact tracking of communication endpoints. The dataset collects both forward and backward traffic information, including the number and total length of packets transmitted in both directions, as well as metrics like maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation of packet lengths.

Temporal variables like as timestamps, flow durations, and inter-arrival times (IAT) provide a temporal understanding of the flows, allowing for the investigation of network activity patterns. Additionally, flow rates, indicated by metrics like as Flow Bytes/s and Flow Packets/s, aid in performance evaluation and anomaly discovery. Flags such as FIN, SYN, and ACK reveal session control information, whereas fields like Active Mean, Idle Mean, and Subflow Statistics characterise flows' behavioural patterns.

Labels such as BENIGN and protocol identifiers (e.g., HTTP\_PROXY, SSL) provide insights about flow classifications, which are critical for cybersecurity analysis. The dataset is rich in characteristics, making it ideal for machine learning models focused on traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and intrusion prevention.

Column to predict:- detect anomalies,traffic types

Dataset size:- 3.2 GB

Dataset description in detail:-

The dataset is intended to collect network traffic statistics, which provides insights into the movement of information between devices across a network. Each entry in the dataset represents a single packet recorded during network traffic analysis, along with pertinent attributes that characterise the packet's path from source to destination. The timestamp, which reveals the exact time the packet was intercepted, and the source and destination IP addresses, which expose the communication's origin and destination, are two important columns. These IP addresses are generally IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that provide information about the involved devices.

The collection also includes information about the source and destination ports, which can be used to identify the individual application or service being used. The protocol field specifies the communication technique utilised, which could be TCP, UDP, or ICMP. The length of the packet is recorded, providing information on the extent of the data sent.

Additional columns detail the content and nature of the traffic, such as the info column, which indicates whether the packet is part of a handshake or a data transfer. Application categories like as video streaming, gaming, and video conferencing are identified, allowing traffic to be categorised depending on its use case. The dataset may also include the geographical locations of the source and destination devices, which provide extra context.

Column to predict:- Fwd Packet Length Max , Bwd Packet Length Mean

Dataset Size:- 16.2 MB

Dataset description in detail:-

The dataset you're working with appears to be focused on network traffic data, maybe for network intrusion detection or anomaly detection. It is likely to have a variety of attributes that indicate packet-level information collected from a network. These features include information about traffic patterns, packet statistics, and overall network performance, which can be utilised to identify odd or malicious activity.

Some frequent columns you may encounter are packet lengths (e.g., "Fwd Packet Length Mean," "Bwd Packet Length Max"), which provide information about the size of packets travelling via the network. Features such as "Flow Duration" and "Total Fwd Packets" reflect the length of a connection and the amount of data transported, respectively. These are critical for analysing traffic patterns and understanding the flow of data.

Additional columns may include flags (e.g., "Protocol Type," "Flag") that describe the packet's type (such as TCP, UDP, or other protocols). Other capabilities, such as "Timestamp" or "Source/Destination IP," provide contextual information about when and where the traffic originated and was routed, allowing you to trace specific network behaviour.

The target column you'd be predicting (for classification or regression) could be a defined category (such as attack vs. typical traffic) or a numerical measurement (such as network delay). The information can be used for developing models to detect security breaches or monitor network health.
